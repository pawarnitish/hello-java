7.mkdir -p directory1/directory2 creates
nested directories, creating directory2
inside directory1 if directory1 does not 
exist.   
Ans:-True
The -p flag in the mkdir command instructs
the system to create all necessary parent 
directories if they don't already exist, 
effectively creating nested directories. 
So, if you run mkdir -p directory1/directory2,
it will create "directory2" inside 
"directory1", even if "directory1" doesn't
 exist yet. 
Key points about mkdir -p:
Creates missing parent directories:
If any directories in the path are missing,
 mkdir -p will create them automatically.

2)"-r": The recursive option, which allows 
deletion of directories and their contents. 
3))"-f": The force option, which bypasses
